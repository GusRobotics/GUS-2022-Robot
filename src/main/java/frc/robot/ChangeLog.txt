TOP PRIORITIES

Variable Distance shooter
 - Need practical data to create a model of distance and power
 - Check on reasonable extreme bounds, relative accuracy

Four/Five Ball High Auto
 - Methods all exist, just a matter of tuning distances and cutting down time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POTENTIAL AUTOMATION

Rewrite Subsystems
 - Drivetrain, index, and intake classes are absent or sketchy, so write some
 - This could be a good programming excersize for new people

Color Vision Processing:
 - Consider using GRIP for color vision processing with balls: autonomous and teleoperated implications. 
 - Would identifying bumpers as balls be an issue?
 - How could this be implemented in teleop?

 Real Time Angle Adjustment for High Shot
  - Realigning during approach in terms of angle

 Tracking Balls in Robot
  - Through cameras or color sensors, detect balls that enter the robot
  - Retract intake if there are two of the right color
  - Spit out balls of the wrong color
  - Hilight nearest ball
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTROL SYSTEM UPGRADES

Controller Rumble
 - Get controller to move in relation to certain tasks

LEDs
 - Get the LEDs on the robot to signify certain points of the match

Audio Feedback
 - Drive station makes noise to alert drives of certain things
 - Some research tells me this is both possible and used by 330 to some success (beep for turret good)
